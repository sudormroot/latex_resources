:Title: Filling an area between plots
:Tags: 2D;Filling;Functions
:Author: Stefan Kottwitz
:Slug: fill-between-plots

With pgfplots 1.10 and its fillbetween library we can
fill the area between curves in a new convenient way:

 - draw the first function and give it a name
 - draw the second function and name it too
 - add a fill between plot

This Code was posted by Stefan Kottwitz to TeX.SE,
modifying an answer of Gonzalo Medina there.
