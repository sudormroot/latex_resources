:Title: Streamline data
:Tags: 2D;
:Author: Paul Gessler
:Slug: streamline-data

I enjoy the simplicity of the code and the quality of the result. It uses
pgfplots to display streamline data for vortex shedding from a square block
at Re=100. The streamline data were computed by a Fortran code I wrote to
model the flow.

The data files are quite large; they are available here for anyone wishing
to reproduce my result. The full paper is available for download on:
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10724484/TeX.SX/StreamlineData.zip
It includes many similar figures showing different times during the vortex
shedding process.
